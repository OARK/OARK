# Virtual Machine

In order to get a consistent development environment, this directory includes a Vagrant file that can be used to easily create a virtual machine to build the software for the project.

## Requirements

Vagrant is required, then either VirtualBox, or VMWare need to be installed. Vagrant requires a paid licence to use VMWare, so that will be required as well. A 64bit host system is also assumed.
