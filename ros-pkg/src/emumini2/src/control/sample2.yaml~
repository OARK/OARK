#A tentative YAML configuration file for the six wheeled wonder.

#The inputs. These correspond to widgets that will appear on the
#android controller. The exact number and type of each widget 
#attribute is still to be decided. The current attributes are:
#
#   type:
#       This determines the actual widget that will appear
#       on the android device. Currently only analog and 
#       slider are supported.
#   position:
#       This determines the position of the widget on
#       the android screen.
#   title (optional):
#       Text to display alongside the widget on
#       the android device. If this field is not
#       present, then no text is displayed.
#   axes (analog, optional):
#       The axes that on which the analog stick should allow
#       movement. Valid options are X, Y, XY or YX. There is
#       no difference between XY and YX as a value for this
#       option. An unused axis will always have the value of
#       0 when referenced in a controller value.
#
#All inputs must provide values between -1 and 1. This entire range
#need not be used as the values that an input provides depend on the
#input itself.
#Scaling and translation of this input may need to occur and should
#be specified in the input if deemed necessary.

#Specifies the controllers created in the software.
#A controller contains the following fields.
#
#   id - The dynamixel ID of the motor that the controller
#        corresponds to.
#   type - Specifies whether the controller is a torque controller
#          or a position controller.
#   min  - The minimum value that the controller may take. This
#          field should be converted to some standard coordinate
#          value at some point.
#   max  - The maximum value that the controller may take. Should
#          be converted to a standard coordinate at some point.
#   value - The value that the controller is to take. *Must be a 
#           string*.
#           This should be a valid python expression that takes
#           any number of inputs and combines them using valid
#           python operations. The result should be a float that
#           will be sent to the AX12 motor.
#           Functions from the python math module may be used,
#           and they need not be namespaced (i.e use sin rather
#           than math.sin).
#           For example:
#               value: 'sin(input1) + 3 * input2'
#           will pass sin(input1)+3*input2 to the controller.
#           Values outside of [-1,1] will be truncated into that
#           range.
