#The inputs. These correspond to widgets that will appear on the
#android controller. The exact number and type of each widget 
#attribute is still to be decided. The current attributes are:
#
#   type - This determines the actual widget that will appear
#          on the android device. Currently only analog and 
#          slider are supported.
#   position - This determines the position of the widget on
#              the android screen.
#   title (optional) - Text to display alongside the widget on
#                      the android device. If this field is not
#                      present, then no text is displayed.
#
#All inputs must provide values between -1 and 1. This entire range
#need not be used as the values that an input provides depend on the
#input itself.
#Scaling and translation of this input may need to occur and should
#be specified in the input if deemed necessary.
