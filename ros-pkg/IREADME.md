Internal readme
===============

This directory (ros-pkg) is the base of the catkin workspace. This catkin workspace can be used to build any and all ros packages that we develop. To be able to properly use this workspace you must:

*Go to the the root of the workspace (current directory) and type 'catkin_make'
*Source *setup.bash* inside of the newly created devel directory. I would strongly recommend adding this source command to your shell startup script.
