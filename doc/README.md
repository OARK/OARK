Notably, this directory contains the following subdirectories:

    The documentation that exists on the OARK wiki. This documentation is
mostly user focused. One should keep in mind, however, that the users and the
developers of this software coincide to some degree.

*   ros-oark

    Documentation of the ROS nodes that operate on the Raspberry Pi.

*   android-oark

    Documentation of the Android application used to control the on-board
software.
