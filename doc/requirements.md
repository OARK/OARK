## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define and agree upon a set of requirements
to be satisfied, goals to be met, and standards that should be upheld during
the development of the Open Framework for Controlling Low Cost 3D Robots,
henceforth referred to as "Ophir" for brevity, a nickname which is inspired by
its similarity to a subsequence of the project name's initial letters.
